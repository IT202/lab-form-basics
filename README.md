# Lab - Forms, form handling, and Heroku

In this lab, you'll learn a bit more about forms and how they are processed.   Because you'll need some page that demonstrates server-side processing, we'll create a PHP file to respond to the form submission.

And we'll take this opportunity to learn how to put our work on the web on Heroku, where - unlike Cloud9 - the server processes won't time out and exit.
