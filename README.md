# Lab - Forms, form handling, and Heroku

In this lab, you'll learn a bit more about forms and how they are processed.   Because you'll need some page that demonstrates server-side processing, we'll create a PHP file to respond to the form submission.

And we'll take this opportunity to learn how to put our work on the web on Heroku, where - unlike Cloud9 - the server processes won't time out and exit.

##Step 1

Clone this repository into your Cloud9 workspace.

##Step 2

Open the index.html file, add some form controls to the form.   Give the form an action attribute with a value of **https://preview.c9users.io/dphayes/it202/lab-forms-and-heroku/form_handler.html**

##Step 3

Download the source file(s), then upload them into the Cloud9 directory that was created in step 1.   (You can upload an entire folder to Cloud9.)

##Step 4

Edit the template to replace all the default content (text, images, map location, etc.) with your own content.   You'll probably have to spend some time "inspect"-ing elements using the Dev Tools to start understanding where any given display element is defined in the template.   


##Step 5

Make sure to use the git commands to add and commit your files.



##Comments and Hints

I expect you to run into problems, but they should easy to fix once you understand the issue.   Don't fight for too long on your own before you post questions on Piazza.

Cloud9 lets you view Revision History;  the option is under the "File" menu option.
